# Overview
General documentation of our distillation automation project.

This document is structured into two major sections:
1. An introduction to the technology and theory behind automating the process of distillation
2. Detailed documention of the source code, generated using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/).

The introductory can be used for a broad overview and links to code sections for more details.
The most recent version of the documentation can also be found [online](https://cs.labme.me/ws1819/distillation/index.html).

## Basics
The goal in this practical course was to automate a distillation process. 
See [Basics](@ref md_docs_01-basics) for a quick summary on distillation and the hardware setup.

## Software Architecture
For a broad overview on the software, see [Software Architecture](@ref md_docs_02-architecture).

## Hardware
Consult the [hardware](@ref md_docs_03-hardware) chapter for info on the main board and the peripherals used.

## Automated Distillation
The actual distillation routines are described in detail in the chapter [distillation](@ref md_docs_04-distillation).  
It describes both the linear controller as well as details on both the theory behind the physical model controller and the implementation using a finite state machine (FSM).

## Contributing
See [contributing instructions](@ref md_docs_05-contributing) to get started with development. (Currently only available in German)
