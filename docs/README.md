# Overview
[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/89d630a35a1e81100b7fee761a422585332f6bf1976b6fce7f.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/tjdev/distillation-automation)

Software for our distillation automation project.
The goal in this practical course was to automate a distillation process. 

The [documentation](https://cs.labme.me/ws1819/distillation/index.html)
is automatically generated from [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) source comments.

## Basics
See [Basics](@ref md_docs_01-basics) for a quick summary on distillation and the hardware setup.

## Software Architecture
For a broad overview on the software, see [Software Architecture](@ref md_docs_02-architecture).

## Hardware
Consult the [hardware](@ref md_docs_03-hardware) chapter for info on the main board and the peripherals.

## Automated Distillation
The actual distillation routines are described in detail in the chapter [distillation](@ref md_docs_04-distillation).  
It describes both the linear controller as well as details on both the theory behind the physical model controller and the implementation using a finite state machine (FSM).

## Contributing
See [contributing instructions](@ref md_docs_05-contributing) to get started with development.
